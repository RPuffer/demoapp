# A Simple Node App to Apply Docker Containerized Workflow

## Uses Local MySql Server for Data Transactions

Without a local/dockerized mysql instance - the app will not perform as expected

 -  To see the app functioning, install mysql and create a database/test table
 -  Then, configure /api/keys.js to reflect your instance of mysql
